/* Imagine a mystical garden with eight enchanted flower beds arranged in a straight line. In each bed, a magical blossom can either be in full bloom (represented by 1) or remain dormant (represented by 0). 
Every day, the garden performs its magic ritual: 
- The state of each blossom is updated based on the state of the two neighboring flower beds. 
- Specifically, if both neighbors of a flower bed are either blooming or both are dormant, then the blossom in that bed will bloom the next day; 
- otherwise, it will remain dormant. 

Note that since the garden is arranged in a single row, the first and the last flower beds have only one neighbor each and thus cannot satisfy the two-neighbor conditionâ€”they will always become dormant the next day.

You are provided with an integer array plots of length 8 where plots[i] == 1 indicates that the blossom in the ith bed is blooming, and plots[i] == 0 means it is dormant. You are also given an integer n which represents the number of days this transformation ritual takes place.

Your task is to determine the state of the garden after n days of magical transformation.

Example 1:
input=
0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
7
output=
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Explanation: 
The garden transforms as follows over 7 days:  
  - Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  
  - Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  
  - Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]  
  - Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  
  - Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]


Example 2:
input=
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
1000000000
output=
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] 

Explanation: After one billion days of transformation, the garden settles into the final state [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].

Constraints:

- plots.length == 8  
- plots[i] is either 0 or 1.  
- 1 <= n <= 10^9
