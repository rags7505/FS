/*
You are an architect designing a street with houses represented as a 0-indexed 
array house_heights of n integers, where each element represents the height of 
a house. Additionally, a binary array visibility_mask of length n is provided, 
where 1 indicates a house that contributes to the neighborhood's skyline, and 
0 indicates a house that does not.

For any house located at index i, you are tasked with determining the average 
skyline height within a k-radius neighborhood centered at i. The average skyline
height is the average of all house heights between indices i - k and i + k 
(inclusive) that have a corresponding visibility value of 1 in the visibility_mask. 

If no houses with a visibility of 1 exist in the range, or if the range extends 
beyond the boundaries of the array, the average skyline height for that house is -1.

Return an array skyline_avgs of length n, where skyline_avgs[i] is the average 
skyline height for the neighborhood centered at index i.

Input Format:
---------------
Line-1: Two space separated integers, N, K
Line-2: N space separated integers, house_heights[].
Line-3: N space separated integers, visibility_mask[].

Output Format:
-----------------
An integer array, priority_sums[], of length n - k + 1


Sample Input-1:
---------------
7 2
10 15 20 5 30 25 40
1 0 1 1 0 1 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[-1, -1, 11, 16, 22, -1, -1]


Explanation:
------------
- For index 0, there are less than k houses in the left neighborhood, 
  so skyline_avgs[0] = -1.
- For index 1, there are less than k houses in the left neighborhood, 
  so skyline_avgs[1] = -1.
- For index 2, the neighborhood is [10, 15, 20, 5, 30]. From the visibility_mask, 
  only the houses with heights [10, 20, 5] contribute to the skyline. 
  The average is (10 + 20 + 5) / 3 = 11.
- For index 3, the neighborhood is [15, 20, 5, 30, 25]. From the visibility_mask, 
  only the houses with heights [20, 5, 25] contribute. 
  The average is (20 + 5 + 25) / 3 = 16.
- For index 4, the neighborhood is [20, 5, 30, 25, 40]. 
  From the visibility_mask, only the houses with heights [20, 5, 25, 40] contribute. 
  The average is (20 + 5 + 25 + 40) / 4 = 22.
- For index 5, there are less than k houses in the right neighborhood, 
  so skyline_avgs[5] = -1.
- For index 6, there are less than k houses in the right neighborhood, 
  so skyline_avgs[6] = -1.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 1
50 60 70
1 1 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[-1, 60, -1]

Constraints:
------------
1. n == house_heights.length == visibility_mask.length
2. 1 <= n <= 10^5
3. 0 <= house_heights[i] <= 10^5
4. visibility_mask[i] is either 0 or 1
5. 0 <= k <= n
